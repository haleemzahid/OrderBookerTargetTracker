# Business Intelligence Dashboard Implementation Tasks

## Executive Summary
This document outlines the comprehensive implementation of a business intelligence dashboard for the Order Booker Target Tracker application. The dashboard will provide actionable insights for wholesale business owners in Pakistan, following principles from business management and The Personal MBA framework.

## Business Context & Motivation

### Target Users
- **Primary**: Business owners managing wholesale operations in Pakistan
- **Context**: Single-user desktop application - no user roles or permissions needed
- **Platform**: Desktop-only application - no mobile optimization required

### Core Business Problems Being Solved
1. **Performance Visibility**: "How is my business performing right now?"
2. **Resource Optimization**: "Where should I focus my attention and resources?"
3. **Risk Management**: "What problems need immediate attention?"
4. **Growth Planning**: "What opportunities am I missing?"
5. **Team Management**: "How are my order bookers performing?"

## Key Business Questions the Dashboard Must Answer

### Financial Performance
- **Revenue Health**: Are we hitting our revenue targets?
- **Profitability**: What's our profit margin and how is it trending?
- **Cash Flow**: How much money is tied up in returns vs net sales?
- **Cost Control**: Are our costs under control relative to revenue?

### Sales Performance
- **Target Achievement**: Who's on track to meet monthly targets?
- **Sales Velocity**: How fast are we closing orders?
- **Product Performance**: Which products drive the most profit?
- **Seasonal Patterns**: How do sales vary by time periods?

### Operational Efficiency
- **Order Fulfillment**: How quickly do we process orders?
- **Return Management**: What's our return rate and why?
- **Team Productivity**: Orders per day per order booker?
- **Quality Control**: Which products/bookers have high return rates?

### Strategic Insights
- **Growth Opportunities**: Which products/regions are underperforming?
- **Risk Indicators**: Early warning signs of problems?
- **Resource Allocation**: Where should we invest more effort?
- **Competitive Position**: How are we trending vs historical performance?

## Default Dashboard Layout Priority

### Top Priority Widgets (Always Visible, Prominent Position)
1. **Revenue Performance Widget** - Top-left position, large size
2. **Profit Margin Gauge Widget** - Top-center position, medium size  
3. **Alert Center Widget** - Top-right position, medium size
4. **Target Achievement Progress Widget** - Second row, large size

### Secondary Priority Widgets (Visible by Default)
5. **Top Performers Leaderboard Widget** - Right sidebar, medium size
6. **Sales Trend Chart Widget** - Center area, large size
7. **Return Rate Monitor Widget** - Bottom area, medium size

### Optional Widgets (Hidden by Default, User Can Enable)
8. **Product Performance Matrix Widget** - Advanced analytics
9. **Cash Flow Summary Widget** - Financial details
10. **Order Velocity Widget** - Operational metrics

## Technical Architecture Overview

### Widget-Based System
- **Draggable Widgets**: Users can rearrange dashboard components
- **Configurable Layout**: Show/hide widgets based on preferences
- **Independent Data Loading**: Each widget manages its own state and API calls
- **Global Filters**: Date range, order booker selection affects all widgets
- **Real-time Updates**: Configurable refresh intervals per widget

### Data Architecture
- **Centralized State Management**: Zustand store for global filters and widget configuration
- **Independent Widget State**: Each widget has its own loading/error states
- **Efficient Caching**: React Query for data fetching and caching
- **Progressive Loading**: Critical widgets load first, others follow
- **Default Layout Priority**: Revenue, Profit Margin, and Alerts widgets positioned prominently

## Notes for AI Agents

### Code Quality Standards
- Follow existing codebase patterns from order-bookers and daily-sales-report features
- Use TypeScript strictly - no `any` types
- Implement proper error boundaries and loading states
- Follow Ant Design component patterns and design system guidelines
- **Naming Convention**: Use kebab-case for all file names (all lowercase with dashes: `dashboard-store.ts`, `revenue-performance-widget.tsx`)
- **State Management**: Use Zustand for all global state management, avoid React Context for complex state

### Data Considerations
- Territory field has been removed from order_bookers table (migration_008)
- Use order_booker_id for performance grouping instead of territory
- All monetary values should be formatted with Rs. prefix for Pakistani context
- Date handling should use the existing date configuration in `src/config/date.ts`
- **Single User Application**: No user authentication, roles, or permissions needed

### Performance Priorities
- Critical widgets (revenue, profit, alerts) load first
- Non-critical widgets (detailed analytics) can load progressively
- Implement proper React.memo and useMemo for expensive operations
- Use React Query for all data fetching with appropriate cache times
- **Desktop Only**: No mobile optimization required, focus on desktop user experience
