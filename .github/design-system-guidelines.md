# Design System Guidelines for Order Booker Target Tracker

## Overview
This document outlines the design system approach for the Order Booker Target Tracker application, based on Ant Design with customizations specific to our wholesale business operations in Pakistan.

## User Profile
- Tech-savvy users who aren't necessarily software experts
- Wholesale business operators in Pakistan
- Users need efficiency and clarity in business operations tasks

## Design Principles

### 1. Clarity and Simplicity
- Use clear labels and descriptive texts for all interactive elements
- Maintain consistent layouts across similar page types
- Minimize cognitive load by showing only necessary information

### 2. Business-Focused
- Prioritize data visualization for sales, targets, and performance metrics
- Optimize table layouts for inventory and order management
- Use color coding to indicate status (fulfilled orders, pending payments, etc.)

### 3. Cultural Context
- Use language and imagery appropriate for Pakistani business context
- Support Urdu language integration where needed
- Consider local business practices in workflow design

## Component Usage Guidelines

### Tables
Tables are central to this application for managing orders, inventory, and targets:
- Use zebra striping for better readability of large datasets
- Include clear action buttons for common operations
- Implement fixed headers for long tables
- Use appropriate filters for commonly filtered columns

### Forms
- Group related fields logically
- Use appropriate validation with clear error messages
- Implement auto-save where appropriate to reduce data loss
- Use larger form controls for better touch interaction

### Navigation
- Implement a clear hierarchy in the sidebar navigation
- Use breadcrumbs for deep navigation paths
- Consider a dashboard-style home page with quick access to common tasks

### Data Visualization
- Use charts and graphs for target tracking and performance metrics
- Implement responsive visualizations that work well on various screen sizes
- Maintain consistent color coding across all data visualizations

## Accessibility Considerations
- Ensure sufficient color contrast for all text elements
- Provide keyboard navigation for all interactive elements
- Support screen readers with appropriate ARIA attributes
- Implement focus indicators for keyboard users

## Responsive Design
- Design for both desktop and tablet use cases
- Ensure critical operations work well on smaller screens
- Consider potential mobile use cases for field operations

## Theme Configuration
The application supports both light and dark themes with customized configurations to ensure optimal readability and user experience in both modes.

### Color Palette
- Primary: Blue (#1890ff) - For main actions and primary UI elements
- Success: Green (#52c41a) - For successful operations and positive indicators
- Warning: Gold (#faad14) - For warnings and attention-requiring elements
- Error: Red (#f5222d) - For errors and critical issues
- Background: White/Light Gray - For content areas
- Text: Dark Gray - For primary text content

## Component Guidelines

### Buttons
- Primary buttons: Use for main actions (Save, Submit, etc.)
- Secondary buttons: Use for alternative actions
- Text buttons: Use for tertiary actions or in space-constrained areas
- Danger buttons: Use sparingly, only for destructive actions

### Cards
- Use for grouping related information
- Implement consistent padding and spacing
- Consider collapsible cards for dense information pages

### Modals and Drawers
- Use modals for critical actions requiring immediate attention
- Use drawers for supplementary actions or forms
- Ensure clear dismissal options for all overlay components

## Implementation Notes
The design system is implemented using Ant Design with custom theme configurations located in `src/config/theme.ts`. The theme is applied globally through the `AppContext` provider.
